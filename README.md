# City Of Paris Route Finder ðŸ—¼
> Welcome to our Paris Route Finder Java project!</center> This was developed for our Data Structures and Algorithms 2 assessment for the purpose of finding and visualizing paths between two specified points through the use of different search algorithms on a vector map of Paris.

<br>

## Features

- Search for routes between points/landmarks in Paris.
- Generate multiple route permutations using depth-first search (DFS).
- Find the shortest route using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm or breadth-first search (BFS).
- Discover the most cultural/historic route using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
- Customize routes by avoiding specific landmarks or adding waypoints.
- Use a user-friendly JavaFX graphical user interface with graphical feedback on the map
